This is a ns3 code based on version ns3.24 with our patch in its wifi module to support simuation of ndn mobility (handovers).
It supports mobility in 802.11n wifi access networks.
    - it supports high throughput wifi network simulations (up to 110Mbps)
    - it supports wifi Minstrel rate adaptations
    - it supports RSSI-based auto AP selections when wifi handover needs to occur
    - the features can be enabled/disabled by keeping/removing several Macro definitions in the wifi module source code
